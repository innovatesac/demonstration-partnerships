Rapid changes in technology, industries, and demographics are heightening competition and accelerating changes in consumer demands for services. The expectations of citizens and customers are growing, with increasing demand on core City services. Yet fiscal, regulatory, and organizational limitations challenge municipalities to keep pace. Complex social challenges also continue to evolve, which further emphasize the importance of more creative, multi-disciplinary initiatives. In this context, the City works to implement adopted policy initiatives with increasingly limited resources.

Emerging technologies and public-private partnerships can help provide services more efficiently, meet community needs, and reduce resource consumption. Early government initiatives show potential for public-private partnership to foster key quality of life improvements across sectors, such as improved mobility. Yet to address quickly changing challenges and benefit from new opportunities, a streamlined and adaptive regulatory environment is key. Rapid deployment and demonstration is critical to take advantage of new opportunities in a competitive environment. Flexible, limited-duration partnerships can also allow for the testing and measurement of improvements to quality of life and City services. Such trial testing allows the City to evaluate and prioritize solutions towards adopted policy objectives.

Recognizing that the City of Sacramento cannot develop these new solutions in isolation, the City seeks to work with outside innovators in the private, government, and nonprofit sectors. Partnering with external entities for the purpose of rapid deployment and demonstration requires a new policy framework, including key criteria to prioritize partnership opportunities and maximize their strategic value.
