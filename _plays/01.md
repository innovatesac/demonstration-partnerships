The purpose of the Demonstration Partnerships Policy is to create a framework for innovative demonstration partnerships. The policy facilitates the City in entering into Demonstration Partnership agreements to test, evaluate, and/or demonstrate innovative solutions consistent with specified criteria. The City will use this policy as a tool to improve service delivery and catalyze a vibrant entrepreneurial sphere for broad social, economic, and environmental benefit. This framework seeks to attract and streamline new types of partnerships that meet adopted City goals.

Examples of potential Demonstration Partnerships include but are not limited to citywide car share programs, autonomous vehicle demonstrations, collaborative research and development efforts that augment City services, and the demonstration and potential adoption of new technologies at City facilities.
